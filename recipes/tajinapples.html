        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 apple, cored</li>
                    <li>½ tablespoon chile-lime seasoning (such as Tajin®), or more to taste</li>


                </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <h4><strong>Step 1</strong></h4>
                        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).</li>
                    <h4><strong>Step 2</strong></h4>
                        <li>Thinly slice apple with a mandolin.</li>
                    <h4><strong>Step 3</strong></h4>
                        <li>Place as many apple slices in the air fryer basket as you can, making sure they do not touch.

                        </li>
                    <h4><strong>Step 4</strong></h4>
                        <li>Cook in the air fryer for 12 minutes, working in batches if necessary. Pull the basket out, turn apple slices over, and cook until lightly browned on the other side, 8 to 12 minutes more. Immediately sprinkle with chile-lime seasoning.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2><strong>Cook's Note:</strong></h2>
                <p4>
                    I have an air fryer oven and I do 2 batches with 1 apple. More batches will more than likely have to be cooked in a regular air fryer with a basket.
